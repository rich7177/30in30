      <p>What: Efficiently "augments" existing data with information from a CSV.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Can be made to function automatically.</li>
        <li>Vastly more efficient than variations with <tt>append</tt>
          </li>
      </ol>
      <p>How: lookup &lt;lookup name&gt; &lt;lookup field&gt; AS &lt;matching field in data&gt; OUTPUT/OUTPUTNEW &lt;field in lookup&gt; AS &lt;new name for field from lookup&gt; &lt;maybe another field from lookup&gt; AS &lt;and a new name for it&gt;</p>
      <p>Why: Extremely efficient at adding in relatively small (e.g. not TB!) set of reasonably static data.</p>
      <p>So What: Commonly used to do things like convert status codes into status strings.  Instead of "404" you could build a new field that said "Not Found".</p>

      <html>Note - normally you would use this command against lookups that were defined via the UI (or in .conf files).  By doing it the way we're doing it, we have to specify the CSV file exactly (including the ".csv" at the end), otherwise it works just the same.  Except of course we can make these "automatic".  To do that, see the fine <a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Knowledge/Makeyourlookupautomatic">docs on lookups</a>.
