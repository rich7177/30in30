      <p>What: Renames fields.</p>
      <p>How: <tt>rename oldfieldname AS newfieldname ...</tt>
        </p>
      <p>Why: Makes it look like you know what you are doing.</p>
      <p>So What: Makes 'bad' field names easier to work with, or converts shorthand names to longer ones at the end of your SPL.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Be careful! You'd think <tt>rename</tt> wouldn't cause problems, but you can overwrite fields with null and cause other minor mayhem.</p>

        <p>We're using data we built earlier by using <tt>outputlookup</tt>.  To build this see <a href="outputlookup">outputlookup</a>
        </p>
        <pre>| inputlookup rdf_cars.csv</pre>
        <p>While yours may differ slightly, that data for us is:</p>
      </html>
      <table>
        <search>
          <query>| inputlookup rdf_cars.csv</query>
        </search>
        <option name="count">12</option>

      <title>Our original data</title>
      <html>
        You know, that field <tt>cars</tt> isn't real descriptive.
      </html>
      <table>
        <search>
          <query>| inputlookup rdf_cars.csv</query>

        So we <tt>| rename cars AS "Cars Sold This Hour"</tt> <br/>
      </html>
      <table>
        <search>
          <query>| inputlookup rdf_cars.csv
          | rename cars AS "Cars Sold This Hour"</query>
        </search>

      <title>Another example</title>
      <html>
        You can make all the fields pretty.  Just do yourself a favor, only rename things to have spaces in them at the end of your search. It's painful if you do that too soon.<br/>
      </html>
      <table>
        <search>
          <query>| inputlookup rdf_cars.csv
          | rename "salesperson" AS "Sales Person" </query>
          <earliest>1708873200</earliest>
          <latest>1708959600</latest>
          <sampleRatio>1</sampleRatio>
        </search>
        <option name="count">12</option>
      </table>
    </panel>
    <panel>
      <title>Multiple renames</title>
      <html>
        <p>Also you can rename multiple fields at once, like <tt>| rename salesperson AS "Sales Person" cars AS "Cars Sold" _time as Time</tt>.  <br />NOTE _time is even more special than the other _* fields.  It is stored as unix epoch time, then at display time converted to your default time format.  When you rename it, that specialness gets lost.  You can "fix" it with eval though.</p>
