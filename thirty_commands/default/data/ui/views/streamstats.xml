      <p>What: Process events as they stream through, adding summary statistics to each event either individually or in a "window".</p>
      <ol>
        <li>There's a lot of options you can use for how to reset statistics, change windows sizes and so on.  We'll touch on a few of these but see the docs!</li>
        <li>Options for <tt>window=&lt;integer&gt;</tt> and <tt>time_window=&lt;span-length&gt;</tt> are probably the most commonly used.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>How: <tt>|streamstats [all kinds of options here] function(field) [AS field], function(field) [AS field], ... [BY field...]</tt>
        </p>
      <p>Why: Allows you to do all sorts of analysis that isn't easily done without it.  Time-window math/counts, running counts, etc. </p>
      <p>So What: Streamstats, especially with time or other windows, is really powerful and solves problems that are simply unsolveable without it.  I also believe streamstats is probably the neatest command in all of Splunk. </p>

      <title>NOT USING JOIN</title>
      <html>The Splunk command <tt>join</tt> is almost never what you want.  Here's an example where you combine two completely different sets of data by using <tt>stats</tt> instead of <tt>join</tt>.
      The important point here is that the two searches on each side of the <tt>OR</tt> could be *any* two searches. If they share a common field, you use <tt>stats ... by</tt> to group them.
