      <p>What: Similar to <tt>timechart</tt> and <tt>stats</tt>, but has the ability to use both axes at once.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <tt>OVER</tt> is the Y axis</li>
        <li>
            <tt>BY</tt> is the X axis</li>
        <li>You actually don't need to use both parameters if you don't want.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>How: <tt>chart &lt;aggregation terms&gt; OVER &lt;field&gt; BY &lt;field&gt;</tt>
        </p>
      <p>Why: <tt>chart</tt> does a job that's nearly impossible without it.  See the examples!</p>
      <p>So What: Usually, but not always, <tt>chart</tt> is a command used to really alter the structure of data, moving things that weren't an axis into being an axis, and vice versa.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Notes: I always get <tt>over</tt> and <tt>by</tt> clauses mixed up, but sometimes that gives me an interesting thing in its own right.  Don't be scared to try flipping those two!</p>

      <html>
        Adding <tt>| chart  sum(cars) as "Cars Sold This Hour" over salesperson by _time</tt> changed it into a two-important-axis chart.

      <table>
        <search>
          <query>| inputlookup rdf_cars.csv | eval _time = strftime(_time, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
